            Ambition is a task management web application that provides a to-do list,
            weather forecasts, and inspirational quotes to help users get ready for
            their day.
            The inspiration for this project came from when my friends and I were talking
            about how we check several different apps when we wake up. That conversation
            gave me the idea to create a dashboard that compiles all the information
            we usually check upon waking up into one place.

            The front end and back end of the website were made using Python and Flask. I used
            Bootstrap to design the front end. The website is hosted on PythonAnywhere.
