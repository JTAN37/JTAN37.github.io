        <p class="about-me">
          My name is Jeremy Tan and I'm a senior at Northwestern University.
          I'm a computer science major in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences.
          From kindergarten to high school, I lived in Singapore and attended the Singapore
          American School.
          <br>
          <br>
          My first introduction to computer science was in my AP Computer Science class in Java
          during my sophomore year of high school. I enjoyed the class so much that the following
          summer I did the Harvard CS50 course to learn C and Python.
          Since then, I've dabbled in a lot of different areas of software engineering, but my
          favorite topics would probably be web development and app development.
          <br>
          <br>
          Outside of coding, I enjoy any sort of physical activity. In high school,
          I was the captain of my school's volleyball and track teams. I also have a lot
          of experience playing basketball and tennis. I love watching soccer but I'm terrible at it ðŸ˜….
